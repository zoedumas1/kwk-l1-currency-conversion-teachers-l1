##Today's Code Challenge!

**Challenge 1:** Temperature Conversion
Write two methods: one named `c_to_f` and one named `f_to_c`. The method called `c_to_f` should take a temperature in celsius as an argument, and return the equivalent temperature in fahrenheit. The method `f_to_c` should do the reverse: it should take a temperature in fahrenheit as an argument, and return the equivalent temperature in celsius.
